A simple Chrome extension that lets you block websites:

1. Indefinitely
2. For specific times during the day or week

## TODO

- [ ] Design default popup UI
- [ ] Design data format for Chrome storage insertions
- [ ] URL validation
- [ ] Add support for blocking on specific days of the week. Within each day, be able to specify blocked times
